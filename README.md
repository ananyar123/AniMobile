# AniMobile

Inspiration

During our summer at Princeton, we were surrounded by wildlife including squirrels, random raccoons, and most notably, a family of foxes. Seeing these unique creatures up close was rare and students always made sure to snap a photo to share on social media. Aside from the novelty, it is important to note that not all wild animals are safe to be around; that's where animal control comes in. AniMobile is a combination of both the exiting aspects of seeing wildlife in person and sharing with peers as well as the professional side, ensuring the public knows how to respond when a furry friend is spotted. 

We also believe this could be a useful tool to mobilize response when searching for a lost pet. Individuals who lose an animal can create a post with tagged zipcodes and an optional reward.Facebook has been a common tool to spread awareness of strays, however, many scams in the recent years have created distrust and skepticism around giving help. With our vetted and structured system, our users can opt to assist the pet owner in their search and potentially get paid in doing so; a win-win for both parties! 


Functionality

The basic components of this app involve account creation for both standard users (Explorers) and professionals in local government (Pros). A standard user would have the ability to browse a local map of animal sightings, post their own sightings on a map to earn badges, connect with friends, and become educated on what to do when encountering certain animals that may pose a threat (bears, wolves, snakes, etc).
